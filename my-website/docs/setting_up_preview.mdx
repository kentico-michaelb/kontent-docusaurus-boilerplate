To set up preview URLs for your project:

1.  In Kentico Kontent, choose  Project settings   from the app menu.
2.  Under Environment settings, choose Preview URLs.
3.  Type in the preview URLs for each type of preview-able content.

Example:

More details about setting up preview and Web Spotlight can be seen in the [official Kentico Kontent documentation.](https://docs.kontent.ai/tutorials/develop-apps/build-strong-foundation/set-up-preview "Kontent Documentation - set up preview for content items")

:::info Running Preview Locally

Preview URLs require an `https://` protocol and a URL accessible to Kontent. Without a valid SSL certificate, Kontent responds with secure connection errors.

When developing apps locally, see how to [serve pages over HTTPS](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/using-https-in-development/) in combination with [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/docs)'s forwarded address.
