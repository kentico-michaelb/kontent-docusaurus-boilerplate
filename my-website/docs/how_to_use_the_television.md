Many newer televisions do not require any special installation to work with the ETSU cable television system. Before you call the Information Technology Services Help Desk, please read and follow these steps:

1.  Check to assure that the television is connected to an electrical outlet and to the cable coax outlet. To connect the TV and cable outlet you will need a coaxial cable. These cables are usually available at any electronics retailer.
2.  If you have a remote control, make sure it is working.
3.  If you do not receive all of the channels listed on the channel lineup, your TV may need to be setup and programmed.  
    All modern televisions have similar setup steps to prepare them to receive cable channels. Please refer to your owner's manual for steps specific to our TV model.
