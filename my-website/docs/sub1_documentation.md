A **swimming pool**, **swimming bath**, **wading pool**, **paddling pool**, or simply **pool** is a structure designed to hold water to enable [swimming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_swimming "Human swimming") or other leisure activities. Pools can be built into the ground (in-ground pools) or built above ground (as a freestanding construction or as part of a building or other larger structure), and may be found as a feature aboard ocean-liners and cruise ships. In-ground pools are most commonly constructed from materials such as [concrete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete "Concrete"), natural stone, metal, plastic, or [fiberglass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiberglass "Fiberglass"), and can be of a custom size and shape or built to a standardized size, the largest of which is the [Olympic-size swimming pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic-size_swimming_pool "Olympic-size swimming pool").
